DATA_STRUCTURE for each subject:

for each subject, the folder contains the following files:
%%% 
choice data, consist of the following file name: choice_subject_%d1_cate_%d2.mat
d1: subject number
d2: 2 = snacks, 3 = music, 5 = films, 235 = all three categories together 

  In each choice data file : 
    per row = per trial

      column 20 = value_item6 (the rating of item 6, NaN if sequance is shorter than 6)
      column 21 = which_item1 (item 1 ID)
      column 22 = which_item2 (item 2 ID)
      column 23 = which_item3 (item 3 ID)
      column 24 = which_item4 (item 4 ID, NaN if sequance is shorter than 4)
      column 25 = which_item5 (item 5 ID, NaN if sequance is shorter than 5)
      column 26 = which_item6 (item 6 ID, NaN if sequance is shorter than 6)
      column 27 = location_item1 (which one of the 6 location on the screen located item 1)
      column 28 = location_item2 (which one of the 6 location on the screen located item 2)
      column 29 = location_item3 (which one of the 6 location on the screen located item 3)
      column 30 = location_item4 (which one of the 6 location on the screen located item 4, NaN if sequance is shorter than 4)
      column 31 = location_item5 (which one of the 6 location on the screen located item 5, NaN if sequance is shorter than 5)
      column 32 = location_item6 (which one of the 6 location on the screen located item 6, NaN if sequance is shorter than 6)
      column 33 = viewing_time1 （the browsing time of item 1)
      column 34 = viewing_time2 （the browsing time of item 2)
      column 35 = viewing_time3 （the browsing time of item 3)
      column 36 = viewing_time4 （the browsing time of item 4, NaN if sequance is shorter than 4)
      column 37 = viewing_time5 （the browsing time of item 5, NaN if sequance is shorter than 5)
      column 38 = viewing_time6 （the browsing time of item 6, NaN if sequance is shorter than 6)
      column 39 = choice (which option did subject choose in the end)
      column 40 = response_time (the response time, calculated as the response cue offset to the choice response onset) 
      column 41 = confidence (confidence reporting for that trial, from 0 to 100)
      column 42 = the horizental position of the chosen item on the screen
      column 43 = the vertical position of the chosen item on the screen
      column 44 = the distance of the position between the second best item and the best item (2nd - best)
      column 45 = ranking of the first item
      column 46 = ranking of the second item
      column 47 = ranking of the third item
      column 48 = ranking of the fourth item
      column 49 = ranking of the fifth item
      column 50 = ranking of the sixth item
      column 51 = transfer category 2,3,5 into 1,2,3
      
      clicks_alltrials: variable that contains 1*84 cell, describing how the subject click the items during choice phase on the touchscreen
      each cell contains:
      (1) (2) the clicking patterns (in terms of x,y location on the scree) after choice cue offset
      (3) the time of the click
      (4) which option does each click corresponds to

likability rating data for each item, consist of the following file name: 
(1) pleasantRating_1_subject_%d1_cate_%d2.mat: first rating round before choice
(2) pleasantRating_2_subject_%d1_cate_%d2.mat: second rating round after choice
d1: subject number
d2: 2 = snacks, 3 = music, 5 = films, 235 = all three categories together
Each of the .mat file contains two structures: rating and tm
  rating.orginalpos = the starting position of the cursor (1*60items)
  rating.scoreFinal = the final rating of the item (1*60items)
  rating.orderItem = items rating as shown order is randomized, 
  rating.permorder = the order of the permutation
  rating.compound = minus rating + response time in seconds (used to rank the items)
  rating.sort_compound = the sorted rating.compound in the order of higher rating + quicker response time
  rating.index_compound = the sorting index
  
  tm.cross_start = at the beginning of the trial, the fixation cross onset time
  tm.cross_end = the fixation cross offset time
  tm.response = response time from fixation offset to response confirmation
  tm.orderitem = response time organized according to the order of the items

%% for some subjects, we also tested the familiarity to different items:
familiarity_Rating_subject_%d1_cate_%d2.mat
d1: subject number
d2: 2 = snacks, 3 = music, 5 = films
