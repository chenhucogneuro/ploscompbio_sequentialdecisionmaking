DATA_STRUCTURE for each subject:

for each subject, the folder contains the following files:
  (1) choice_subject_1_cate_1.mat - subject 1 choice data for category 1 stimuli (vegitables and fruits)
  (2) choice_subject_1_cate_2.mat - subject 1 choice data for category 2 stimuli (snacks)
  (3) choice_subject_1_cate_3.mat - subject 1 choice data for category 3 stimuli (music)
  (4) choice_subject_1_cate_4.mat - subject 1 choice data for category 4 stimuli (readings)
  (5) choice_subject_1_cate_5.mat - subject 1 choice data for category 5 stimul (films)
  (6) choice_subject_1_cate_15.mat - subject 1 choice data for stimuli from all categories together
